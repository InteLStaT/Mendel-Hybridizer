Feature ideas:
- program should be able to "hybridize two organisms" and display
information about the hybrid's genetic information, as per Mendel
	- up to some set (or arbitrary) number of generations
	- up to some set (or arbitrary) number of allele pairs
	- show genotypic and phenotypic ratio of the hybrids
		- show the calculations needed to reach the results
	- display a Punnett square for the last generation or for all generations
- should contain several example hybridizations
- should contain specialized hybridizations
	- one which follows the change in facial traits
	- one which follows the traits of peas
	(add other examples later)
- be able to save these results into files
- should be internationalized ✓
- nicely formatted mathematics (especially the ratios)

- add support for incomplete dominance and codominance
