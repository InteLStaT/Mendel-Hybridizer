Feature ideas:
- program should be able to "hybridize two organisms" and display 
information about the hybrid's genetic information, as per Gregor Mendel
	- up to some set (or arbitrary) number of generations
	- up to some set (or arbitrary) number of allele pairs
	- show genotypic and phenotypic ratio of the hybrids
		- show the calculations needed to reach the results
	- display a Punnett square
		- for the last generation or for all generations
		- if it's too big, might not need to display, or display it
		separately
- be able to save these results into files
- should be internationalized ✓
- nicely formatted mathematics (especially the ratios)

UI design ideas:
- should have tabs each capable of displaying hybridisation results
	- each tab should be broken down into panels
	└ 1. name of the hybridisation/experiment/whatever
	└ 2. hybridizer text fields and controls
	└ 3. possible gametes
	└ 4. genotypic ratios (probabilities) of hybrids in a table
	└ 5. phenotypic ratios (probabilites) of hybrids in a table
	└ 6. Punnett square (not necessary)
		- might allow to move up and down some of these
┌ a welcome tab showing instructions ✓
└ or help tips on hovering above controls or something

Development ideas:
- class Genotype
	- holds genotype information, like "AABbcc"
		- each allele is held separately
	- can give the phenotype based on itself, like "ABc"
